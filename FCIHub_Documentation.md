## Chapter 1: Introduction and Background

### 1.1 Introduction

FCIHub is a comprehensive academic management system designed specifically for the Faculty of Computer and Information (FCI). Built using modern web technologies, FCIHub serves as a centralized platform that streamlines academic operations, enhances communication between students and faculty, and provides efficient management of educational resources.

The system is developed using NestJS framework with TypeScript, providing a robust and scalable backend architecture. It integrates with PostgreSQL database for reliable data storage and implements JWT-based authentication for secure access control.

### 1.2 Problem Definition

Traditional academic management in universities faces several critical challenges:

1. **Fragmented Information Systems**: Academic information is scattered across multiple platforms, making it difficult for students and faculty to access comprehensive data.

2. **Inefficient Communication**: Limited channels for announcements, events, and academic updates lead to poor information dissemination.

3. **Manual Course Management**: Traditional methods of managing courses, materials, and schedules are time-consuming and error-prone.

4. **Limited Resource Accessibility**: Students struggle to access course materials, lecture schedules, and academic resources in a centralized manner.

5. **Administrative Overhead**: Faculty and administrators spend excessive time on routine tasks that could be automated.

### 1.3 What is the importance of this problem?

The importance of addressing these academic management challenges cannot be overstated:

**For Students:**
- Improved access to academic resources and information
- Better organization of course materials and schedules
- Enhanced communication with faculty and peers
- Streamlined academic planning and progress tracking

**For Faculty:**
- Reduced administrative burden
- Efficient content distribution and management
- Better student engagement and communication
- Streamlined grading and assessment processes

**For Institution:**
